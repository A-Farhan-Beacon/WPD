                The Kaaba (Arabic: ٱلْكَعْبَة‎, romanized: al-Kaʿbah, lit. 'The Cube', Arabic pronunciation: [kaʕ.bah]),
                also spelled Ka'bah or Kabah, sometimes referred to as al-Kaʿbah al-Musharrafah (Arabic: ٱلْكَعْبَة
                ٱلْمُشَرَّفَة‎, romanized: al-Kaʿbah al-Musharrafah, lit. 'Honored Ka'bah'), is a building at the center
                of Islam's most important mosque, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.[1][2] It is the most
                sacred site in Islam.[3] It is considered by Muslims to be the Bayt Allah (Arabic: بَيْت ٱللَّٰه‎,
                lit. 'House of God') and is the qibla (Arabic: قِبْلَة‎, direction of prayer) for Muslims around the
                world when performing salah.

                [almadiːna]), is the second holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi
                Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[2] making it the fourth-most populous
                city in the country.[3] Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the
                country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of
                which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty
                valleys, agricultural spaces and older dormant volcanoes.

                the third holiest site in Islam. The mosque was built on top of the Temple Mount, known as the Al Aqsa
                Compound or Haram esh-Sharif in Islam, several decades after Muhammad's death. Modern Muslims believe
                that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.
                Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the 16th or 17th month after
                his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in
                Mecca.[2]
